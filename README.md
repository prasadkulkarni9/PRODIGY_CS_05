# PRODIGY_CS_05
 The script is a packet sniffer tool developed in Python using the Scapy library. It prompts the user to accept terms and conditions before initiating packet capture. Once accepted, the tool begins sniffing network packets, extracting vital information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and payload data.
It presents this information in the console with TCP payloads displayed in CYAN, UDP payloads in BLUE, and ICMP payloads in YELLOW. Additionally, the captured data is appended to a log file named packet_log.txt. 
This tool is intended for educational and informational purposes only and should not be used for any illegal or unethical activities.
